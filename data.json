We focus on the development of technologies that keep Oracle at the forefront of the computer industry. Oracle Labs researchers look for novel approaches and methodologies, often taking on projects with high risk or uncertainty, or that are difficult to tackle within a product-development organization. Oracle Labs research is focused on real-world outcomes: our researchers aim to develop technologies that will someday play a significant role in the evolution of technology and society. For example, chip multithreading and the Java programming language grew out of work done in Oracle Labs. \nThe Company:\nOracle is the world’s leading provider of business software. With a presence in over 175 countries, we are one of the biggest technology companies on the planet. We're using innovative emerging technologies to tackle real-world problems today. From advancing energy efficiency to reimagining online commerce, the work we do is not only transforming the world of business—it's helping advance governments, power nonprofits, and giving billions of people the tools they need to outpace change. For more information about Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), visit us at oracle.com.\n\n\nWhat You’ll Do:\nMachine learning (ML) is at the forefront of the rising popularity of data-driven software applications. At Oracle Labs, we have a diverse set of ML projects that you could be a part of and make an impact. You can: work in the area of ML for classification, regression, anomaly detection, and forecasting tasks; explore support for federated learning; explore techniques to reduce model bias while tuning; extend dataset support for unstructured (e.g., NLP) and semi-structured (e.g., video/audio/graph) data; extend generic model support including GNNs, DNNs and/or RNNs. The following are two sample projects that you can be a part of (please visit the Oracle Labs internship website for a full listing of ML projects):\n\n\nAutoMLx (Automated ML and explainability): The rapid proliferation of ML technology, explosive data growth, and shortage of data science expertise have caused the industry to face increasingly challenging demands to keep up with fast-paced develop-and-deploy model lifecycles. Moreover, as there is an ever-increasing number of deployed models, automated explainability techniques are required to provide insight into their complex behavior and the data they work with. This group is focused on building a novel framework that gives novice and advanced data scientists the power of AutoML and explainability in a single, easy-to-use, python package.\n\n\nGraph ML: We are actively working on challenging machine learning problems with a focus on graph-represented data. We are developing a state-of-the-art machine learning library primarily to support various graph-based ML techniques. The use-cases of these approaches are vast and span across multiple domains starting from finance, bio-med, to cybersecurity and healthcare. While implementing these functionalities, our focus is on scalability and efficiency.\nThis group is focused on the design and implementation of novel graph learning algorithms (or optimize existing algorithms) that scale-up to large-scale graphs by accounting for the above-mentioned challenges.\n\n\nWhat You’ll Bring: (Objective Minimum Qualifications)\nTo be considered for an internship position in the Oracle Labs organization, you must possess the Objective Minimum Qualifications (OMQs) below.

We are continually innovating so that our customers can deploy advanced and effective tools to protect their communities, countries and companies.\n     \n\n\n Headquartered out of Waterloo, Canada but with over 400 employees spread out globally, Magnet is continuing to expand and grow. Where we are today, is not where we want to be tomorrow.\n     \n\n\n Your Team\n\n\n\n The Idea Lab is a small, entrepreneurial team within Magnet Forensics whose mandate is to discover, explore, and validate new business opportunities within the digital forensics and incident response space. The projects we work on range from emerging problem statements all the way to user-validated products ready for commercialization.\n     \n\n\n We bring to bear the skills of our multi-disciplinary team to move these ideas along, learning as we go. Some ideas aren’t a good fit, while others show promise: we run experiments, build prototypes, and ask a lot of questions so we can have the data necessary to know the difference.\n     \n\n\n Magnet’s mission is to positively impact people’s lives by uncovering the truth and empowering others to make a difference. Our team contributes to that mission by ensuring we’re working on the most important challenges in the smartest way possible.\n     \n\n\n\n The impact of your work\n\n\n\n As a software product developer co-op on the team, your work will:\n     \n\nBe generative. You will help define the problem—not just implement its solution. You will come up with practical ways to answer technical questions, explore problem spaces, and start solving problems before having all the information.\nBe exploratory. Your experience will help guide our research efforts and decision making. You’ll go broad before you go deep. You’ve learned the value of sharing half-baked ideas with teammates early on.\nBe efficient. Sometimes our software will be designed to answer a question, sometimes it will be production-grade and ready for the world; you know the difference and can advocate investing in one area of development over another.\nBe inspiring. We share our work often with the people we’re trying to help—getting feedback helps at every stage. Your work will be seen and used by customers regularly, informing not only our work, but the work of other teams and colleagues within Magnet.\nBe bold. We work on complex challenges that invite bold and unorthodox approaches. You’re not afraid to suggest something that sounds odd or risky, and you build on the ideas of others.\n\n\n\n\n       As a member of the Idea Lab, you have a voice and hand in everything we do.\n     \n\n\n\n What we’re looking for in a team member\n\n\n\n\nComfortable with change. We often need to quickly change direction based on what we’ve learned—or still need to learn. We can be working on more than one idea at a time, ideas can move forward, or ideas can be shelved.\nCurious by nature. As a small team, we share responsibility for many of our activities. Each of us brings our own skill sets, but we look for ways to learn from and help each other. The lines between the activities blur sometimes.\nEmbraces ambiguity. We deal with challenges that no one else has tackled yet. We make decisions based on the data we have, knowing there are areas of the problem space we just don’t know much about yet.\nOpen to trying new ways of doing things. We embrace experimentation, look for inspiration in non-traditional spaces, and measure things to see what works.\nAble to teach and learn. We learn a lot from stakeholders, but also from each other. We need to be able to talk to different audiences about our work. We explore unfamiliar problem spaces often where it is useful to split up the task of learning.\nUnderstands that perfect is the enemy of good. What is the least amount of work necessary to answer a question? Not all our work is polished, but it should be effective. We try to share early and often.\nCares about their craft. As a small team focused on innovation, we care about and invest in the process as much as the outcome.\nKindness. We are a small team that works closely with each other and the people we’re trying to help. We trust each other to be humble professionals.\n\n\n\n\n Qualifications\n\n\n\n Working towards a Bachelor’s degree in an Engineering or Computer Science related field, or equivalent practical experience\nStartup and/or entrepreneurial experience is an asset\nExperience working with a general-purpose programming language\n\n\n\n\n Magnet Forensics Inc. is an affirmative action, equal opportunity employer.
