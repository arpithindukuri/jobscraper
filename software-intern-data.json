We are hiring MS/PhD students with a diverse set of skills and experiences to work in and across multiple teams within the Oracle Labs organization. Our program is intended to enhance your overall learning experience, help build your network, and accelerate your opportunity to make an impact.\n\n\nThe Team: \nOracle Labs is the advanced research and development arm of Oracle. We focus on the development of technologies that keep Oracle at the forefront of the computer industry. Oracle Labs researchers look for novel approaches and methodologies, often taking on projects with high risk or uncertainty, or that are difficult to tackle within a product-development organization. Oracle Labs research is focused on real-world outcomes: our researchers aim to develop technologies that will someday play a significant role in the evolution of technology and society. For example, chip multithreading and the Java programming language grew out of work done in Oracle Labs. \nThe Company:\nOracle is the world’s leading provider of business software. With a presence in over 175 countries, we are one of the biggest technology companies on the planet. We're using innovative emerging technologies to tackle real-world problems today. From advancing energy efficiency to reimagining online commerce, the work we do is not only transforming the world of business—it's helping advance governments, power nonprofits, and giving billions of people the tools they need to outpace change. For more information about Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), visit us at oracle.com.\n\n\nWhat You’ll Do:\nMachine learning (ML) is at the forefront of the rising popularity of data-driven software applications. At Oracle Labs, we have a diverse set of ML projects that you could be a part of and make an impact. You can: work in the area of ML for classification, regression, anomaly detection, and forecasting tasks; explore support for federated learning; explore techniques to reduce model bias while tuning; extend dataset support for unstructured (e.g., NLP) and semi-structured (e.g., video/audio/graph) data; extend generic model support including GNNs, DNNs and/or RNNs. The following are two sample projects that you can be a part of (please visit the Oracle Labs internship website for a full listing of ML projects):\n\n\nAutoMLx (Automated ML and explainability): The rapid proliferation of ML technology, explosive data growth, and shortage of data science expertise have caused the industry to face increasingly challenging demands to keep up with fast-paced develop-and-deploy model lifecycles. Moreover, as there is an ever-increasing number of deployed models, automated explainability techniques are required to provide insight into their complex behavior and the data they work with. This group is focused on building a novel framework that gives novice and advanced data scientists the power of AutoML and explainability in a single, easy-to-use, python package.\n\n\nGraph ML: We are actively working on challenging machine learning problems with a focus on graph-represented data. We are developing a state-of-the-art machine learning library primarily to support various graph-based ML techniques. The use-cases of these approaches are vast and span across multiple domains starting from finance, bio-med, to cybersecurity and healthcare. While implementing these functionalities, our focus is on scalability and efficiency.\nThis group is focused on the design and implementation of novel graph learning algorithms (or optimize existing algorithms) that scale-up to large-scale graphs by accounting for the above-mentioned challenges.\n\n\nWhat You’ll Bring: (Objective Minimum Qualifications)\nTo be considered for an internship position in the Oracle Labs organization, you must possess the Objective Minimum Qualifications (OMQs) below.
